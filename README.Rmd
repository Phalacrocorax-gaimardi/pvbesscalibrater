# pvbesscalibrater

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of pvbesscalibrater is to create a set of weights and empirical partial utilities used by pvbessmicrosimr. This is the micro-calibration step of the ABM. Some of the tasks that pvbesscalibrater handles include

* mapping survey adoption likert scores to partial utilities using a parameter (epsilon) that describes hypothetical bias
* choice of financial variable(s) in ABM (usually highest bill q14, annual bill q_ab or highest and lowest bills q14 and q15)
* finds a set of regularised weights for financial, social and barrier terms


## Installation

You can install the development version of pvbesscalibrater like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github(")
```

## Workflow

This explains the workflow.

```{r example}
library(pvbesscalibrater)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
